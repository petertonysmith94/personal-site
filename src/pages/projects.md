# Projects

I have projects to keep me busy, and to keep me learning about a range of interest. I have a few projects that I am working on, and a few that I have worked on. I am always looking for new projects to work on, and I am always looking for new people to work with. [Hit Me Up](mailto:peter@smiths.im) for a collab.
