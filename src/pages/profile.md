# Profile

¡Hola!

I am a seasoned software engineer hailing from the vibrant city of Bristol, with a lifelong passion for technology and programming that dates back to my early years ([Visual Basic 6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6.0-documentation) - get to know).

I have amassed a wealth of experience and knowledge in the dynamic landscape of Web2, contributing to a variety of projects and honing my skills over the years. However, despite my proficiency in the Web2 space, I find myself yearning for a more fulfilling and cutting-edge environment.

In the pursuit of professional satisfaction and a desire to be at the forefront of technological innovation, I am currently steering my career towards the [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/) space. Fueled by an insatiable curiosity and an eagerness to embrace the decentralized future, I am enthusiastic about diving into the realms of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the broader Web3 ecosystem.
